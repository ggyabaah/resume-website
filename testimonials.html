                <blockquote>"I worked with George whilst leading the Geo-Spatial Analyst team at Standing Joint Command (UK). Throughout his time at Standing Joint Command, he thoroughly impressed both his Line Management and myself.

                    Driven, diligent and proactive, George was the MVP of the SJC J3 Geo-Cell and identified several innovative ways to automate national reporting from Joint Military Commands onto a ArcGIS Online instance; a great demonstration of blue-skies thinking.
                    
                    Throughout the Defense COVID-19 response, George remained cool, calm and collected in the delivery of key decision support products; often under extreme time and resource pressures.
                    
                    I thoroughly enjoyed working with George and would wholeheartedly recommend him to any future employer."</blockquote>
